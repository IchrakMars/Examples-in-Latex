he systematic and statistical errors on the measured masses and radii
of neutron stars currently do not allow to pin down a unique equation of
state for the neutron star matter with just one measurement. However,
by measuring neutron stars with different masses, it is possible to trace
out the mass and radius relation, which would then allow putting tighter
constrains on the equation of state of cold ultra dense matter. The
legacy of more than ten years worth of RXTE, Chandra, and XMM-Newton
observations of neutron stars provides an invaluable archival database
that can be used for the future neutron star mass and radius
measurements hence constraining the equation of state of neutron star
matter.
With the opportunity provided by these archives and using carefully
determined selection criteria, we are continuing to measure the
distances, masses and radii of neutron stars located in the X-ray
bursters. Even though, the systematic errors are expected to be present
to varying degrees in different sources, meaning that the same level of
accuracy in M-R measurements cannot be achieved with every X-ray
burster. Our selection criteria not only leaves clean systems that do not
suffer from the astrophysical complications, but identifies a sufficient
number of them.
Indeed, a small number of clean X-ray bursters are all that is needed for
accurate measurements of the neutron star properties (see Ozel and
Psaltis 2009). Our sample includes more than 15 such candidates which
we are now working on.


Summary

X-ray bursts useful for inferring NS M & R, but we
need better handle on systematics

One can derive M $\&$ R constraints independent of
distance and anisotropy

e.g. anisotropy. Even if distance is perfectly known,
the unknown $\eta$ means R could be uncertain to
within a factor of 2.
We applied this to GS 1826-24, a very well-
understood source. Can be applied to other sources.
