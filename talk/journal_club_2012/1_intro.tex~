{\bf Neutron Stars: What we know and what we do not know.}}
The determination of the equation of state of cold, ultradense matter, such as that found in the interiors of neutron stars, has been one of the key science goals of high-energy astrophysics and nuclear physics. Low mass X-ray binaries that show thermonuclear X-ray bursts are ideal sources to put constraints on the equation of state of neutron star matter. Lack of independent distance measurements for most of these sources, however, prevents a systematic exploration of the mass and radius of these neutron stars, and hence the equation of state at such nuclear densities.
We perform time resolved spectral analyses of the X-ray bursts observed from the low-mass X-ray binaries, and combine the results of this analysis with a novel distance measurement technique, based on near-IR observations of red clump stars along the line of sight and high
energy resolution X-ray spectra of X-ray binaries. When combined, these two analyses enable independent measurements of the neutron star mass and radius.

Time Resolved X-ray Spectroscopy
Using archival RXTE observations of X-ray bursters, we identify thermonuclear X-ray
bursts. For each identified burst, we extract time resolved 2.5−25.0 keV X-ray spectra using
the ftool seextrct for the science event mode data and saextrct tool for the science array
mode data from the all PCA layers. We extract spectra for 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 s time intervals,
depending on the source count rate during the burst. We then model each of these X-ray
spectra with a blackbody function and measure two physical parameters :

Eddington Flux
In each burst, we measure the Eddington flux at the
so-called touchdown point where the photosphere
returns to the neutron star surface following an
expansion event. At this point, the flux is still at the
local Eddington limit and the outermost layers are
radiation pressure supported. Figure 1 shows the
spread of the touchdown fluxes measured in
individual bursts around the central value determined
per source. As can be seen, for numerous sources, the
variation around the mean is less than 10% of the
central value, indicating that, for each source, there is
an intrinsic and reproducible limit that is reached
during the photospheric radius expansion bursts.


apparent radius
During the cooling tail of an X-ray burst the flux and temperature follow a tight,
reproducible correlation throughout the cooling with a power-law index of −4,
indicating a well-defined surface area of the neutron star. The second spectral quantity
is the normalization measurements obtained during the cooling tails of the PRE bursts.
Normalization in the XSPEC model bbodyrad, is related to the apparent blackbody
radius and the distance through A = (Rapp / D10kpc )2 , where R is the apparent radius and
D is the distance in units of 10 kpc. In order to find an average normalization
measurement for each burst, we take the measurements only for selected time
intervals after each burst started, when the apparent radius remained constant.

Distance Measurements 
(Güver, Ozel, Cabrera-Lavers, $\&$ Wroblewski 2008) 
We use two different techniques to measure the distances to X-ray bursters; one is based 
on the known distances to the globular clusters and the other is based on following how 
the extinction varies with distance using red clump stars as our standard candles. 

Red clump giants have long been proposed as standard candles (Paczynski & Stanek 1998).
These are core helium-burning giants with a very narrow luminosity function that
constitute a compact and well-defined clump in an Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram,
particularly in the infrared. Furthermore, as they are relatively luminous, they can be
identified to large distances from the Sun.

As a result, they are excellent infrared standard candles and can be used to study galactic
distances and structure. When red clumps are identified at a range of distances, then the
reddening at each distance can be measured. By comparing the reddening of the target
source with the reddening ladder obtained by the red clump stars, the distance to the
target can be measured.


Bringing all together :
(see e.g. Ozel, Güver, $\&$ Psaltis 2009)
The observed spectroscopic quantities and the distance depend on the stellar mass and
radius according to the relations,

$$F_{TD} = \frac{GMc}{K_{es} D^2} \Big ( 1 - \frac{2GM}{Rc^2} \Big)^{1/2}$$
and
$$ A = \frac{R^2}{D^2f_c^4} \Big( 1 - \frac{2GM}{Rc^2} \Big )^{-1}$$

where $A$ is the blackbody normalization, $F_{TD}$ is the touchdown flux and $k_{es}$ is the opacity to electron scatering, $f_c$ the color correction factor.

In the absence of eerors, these two equatiosca can be solved for the mass and raidus of the neutron star.
