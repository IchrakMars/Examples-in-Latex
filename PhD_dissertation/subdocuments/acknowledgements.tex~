Near the end of \booktitle{The Lord of the Rings}\footnote{If you didn't expect
me to put a \booktitle{Lord of the Rings} quote in my dissertation, then you
must not know me very well.}, when the One Ring finally exhausts Frodo, Samwise
declares, ``I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!''  This dissertation
may have my name on the cover, but there were many who helped to carry me this
far.

Firstly I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, who has been my constant
companion and who gifted us with this beautiful universe to discover.

Without the encouragement and sacrifice of my wife, Erin, this dissertation
would not exist.  I could not hope to list all the ways she has been a blessing
to me.

I never would have begun grad school without the support and encouragement of
my parents, who taught me to work hard in pursuit of what I love.

Despite his protests to the contrary, Alan Calder has been an outstanding
advisor.  He has managed to balance when to step in and offer direction and
when to allow me to find my own way.

The faculty of the Department of Physics and Astronomy have been wonderful.  In
particular, I would like to thank Mike Zingale and Doug Swesty, whose
encouragement and guidance have been greatly appreciated.

Surviving grad school is a team sport.  My thanks also go to my fellow grad
students: Aaron, Chris, Josh, Rahul, Melissa, Adam, Yeunhwan, Kendra, Bryan,
and Stephanie.

My collaborators, Dean Townsley, Ed Brown, and Frank Timmes, have endured an
endless string of revisions of my papers and have patiently helped me develop
my research and refine my writing into work worth publishing.
